# Amazon-regression-project-
This assignment is a sample representation of how I would approach a Quality Engineering project in a real-world environment. The focus is on regression testing for the Amazon Shopping platform, simulating a scenario where a major version update has been released. This update involves significant changes to both the data layer and user interface, which may inadvertently impact existing functionalities.

The assignment includes:

A comprehensive test strategy highlighting critical functional areas such as authentication, product search, cart and checkout, and order management.

Well-structured test cases created in real-time format, including expected vs actual results, test status, and severity for each case.

A recommendation of Selenium as the automation tool, with clear justification based on its capabilities, flexibility, and industry relevance.

This exercise demonstrates my understanding of manual testing principles, test documentation standards, and automation readiness, making it a strong example of my capabilities as a QA professional.
